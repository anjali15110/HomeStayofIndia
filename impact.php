					<p>Homestays of India which has been part of Youthpreneur since its inception, played an integral role during this program conducted at the picturesque Morni Hills, Haryana. Using an intelligent mix of real life case studies and authentic data, the team from HOI facilitated sessions and trained more than 200 youngsters of Morni between the age group of 16 to 29 years. These sessions built around content on eco-tourism and homestay development was further enhanced with the 360-degree support system – mentoring, training, and marketing that Team HOI brought to the training table.</p>
					<p><b>The Youthpreneur Program Impact Dynamics</b></p>
					<p><b>Motivation Translated into Action: </b> As a result of the experienced guidance and expert hand-holding by Homestays of India, a sizeable number of youngsters who attended the camp, confidently chose to invest their energies in opening homestays in Morni. Two homestays are already in operation and the future looks promising with many more scheduled to be operational soon. Visit these </p>
					<p><b>Career Choices Made: </b>  The training at the camp expanded the thinking of the youth and influenced their perspective about their own lives. It helped them understand and appreciate how well tourism development in their area, could alter their way of life and their financial goals for the better. These factors prompted many youths to decide to become tourist/adventure sports guides or start a restaurant/cafe. Some also signed up for starting a cab service.</p>
